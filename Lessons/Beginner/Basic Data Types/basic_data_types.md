# **Basic Data Types**

***

**Summary:**


***

### **Numeric Types**

***

***

#### **Integer (int)**

***

Integers are whole numbers that include negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers such as -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.

Python consider these type of numbers to be of data type `int`.

```Python
>>> 1 + 2
3
>>> 3 - 1
2
>>> 2 * 2
4
>>> 15 / 3
5.0 
```

The division operation result of `5.0` can fuction as a good transition to the floating-point data type.

#### **Floating-Point (float)**

***

A floating-point number is any number that includes a decimal point and in general they can be used like integers. The term floating point comes from the fact that the decimal point can be located anywhere within the number.

Python consider these type of numbers to be of data type `float`.

```Python
>>> 0.5 + 1.0
1.5
>>> 3.0 - 0.5
2.5
>>> 0.5 * 0.5
0.25
>>> 4.0 / 4.0
1.0
```

A division operation between two integers will always result in a float.

```Python
>>> 40 / 20
2.0
```

Any arithmetic operation that contains a mix of a integer and a float will also result in a float.

```Python
>>> 3 - 1.0
2.0
```

#### **String (str)**

```Python

```

### **Boolean Type**

#### **Boolean (bool)**

```Python

```
